# Diwali_Sales_Analysis
This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of Diwali sales to uncover trends, patterns, and insights related to customer behavior and sales performance. The analysis involves data cleaning, transformation, and visualization using Python libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn. Key steps include handling missing values, renaming columns for better readability, and converting data types for accurate numerical operations.

The visualizations explore various aspects of the dataset, such as gender-based purchasing trends, high-spending age groups, state-wise sales performance, and the influence of marital status and occupation on sales. Additionally, the analysis identifies the most popular product categories and top-selling products, providing actionable insights for marketing strategies. This project serves as a practical example of using data analysis techniques to derive meaningful insights from sales data.
